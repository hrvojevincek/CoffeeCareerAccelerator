## ðŸš€ MCP (Model Context Protocol) Setup

This project supports AI-powered database management through Neon's MCP Server, allowing you to interact with your PostgreSQL database using natural language commands.

### Prerequisites
- Neon PostgreSQL database account
- Neon API key
- Cursor IDE (or other MCP-compatible client)

### Setup Steps

1. **Install MCP Server Package**
   ```bash
   cd apps/server
   npm install --save-dev @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon
   ```

2. **Get Your Neon API Key**
   - Go to [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech)
   - Navigate to API Keys in your account settings
   - Create or copy your API key

3. **Configure MCP in Cursor**
   - Copy `mcp-config.example.json` to `mcp-config.json`
   - Replace `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual API key
   - Open Cursor Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
   - Search for "MCP" and add the configuration

4. **Test MCP Connection**
   ```bash
   export NEON_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   npx @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon start $NEON_API_KEY
   ```

### Available MCP Commands
Once configured, you can use natural language commands like:
- "List my Neon projects"
- "Show tables in my database"
- "Run a query to see all users"
- "Create a new table for job applications"

### Security Note
- **Never commit** `mcp-config.json` to version control
- Only use MCP for development, never in production
- Keep your API key secure and private

### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "neon": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon",
        "start",
        "<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
